/*to learn more about packages--- " https://nodesource.com/blog/the-basics-of-package-json "*
 * The package. json file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project such as a name, version, and dependencies which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package.
 * It is always present in the root directory
 * package.json is the central place to configure and describe how to interact with and run your application. It is used by the npm CLI
 * 
 * 
 * 
Package.json is also required which can be considered as a manifest file(stores immportant info about project/package)

3 ways to create package.json
1. manual approach (create package.json in root, create properties etc)
2.npm init (step by step press enter to skip )
3.init -y (everything default)(here the y stands for yes and can be replaced by it)

after using the method in previous file(15)
we can install the package and it will be added in the node modules folder which not yet created will be done by npm
